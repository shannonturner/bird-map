Where do the birds like to hang out?

Birds in DC do lots of things:
* Dust bathe
* Eat bread
* Splash in fountains
* Nap in fountains
* Strut like they own the place
* Nest in our signs

Do you change the route you're walking based on where you know birds will be?
Do you like to watch sparrows dust bathing?
Do you like to feed bread to pigeons?

Yes, me too! That's why I made a map of where you can do those things!

If you like birds as much as I do, you will want to pay attention to the birds!
